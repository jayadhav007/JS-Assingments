1.Comments:
// Double slash for single line comment.
/* Anything between them is considered as a comment.*/

2.Data types in JS?
-> Bollean(true | false)
-> String(A combination of charachter , Put it inside double or single quotes).
-> Number(1 , 2 , 3 , 4, -10 , -55.78).
-> Null (Nothing)
-> Undefined (The data type is not set)
-> Bigint (Big Integer , Reallllllly big numbeer)
-> Symbol data type ([[]], double square bracker)
-> Onject (A collection of properties and function).

3.Data type vs Data structure.
-> Data Structute -> Array , Stacks , Queues , Trees , Graphs , Heaps , Linked list

-> Data Type -> Object , Null , undefined ,etc.

4. How to check the data type?
-> typeof(typeof operator)

5 Primitive Data Type and Non Primitive Data Type?
->Primitive -> Lowest data type of any programming language.it cannot be broken further.
->Non Primitive -> This is combination of other primitive and non primitive data types(objects)

6. JS is a dynamically typed (loosely typed) language..means it does not care about data type and then later update with another data type.

7.Strictly typed language?
-> opp of loosely typed. JAVA , C , C++ , Objective C , Swift

8. Methematical Operator
-> +, - , *, / -> add, sub , multiply, Divide.
-> % -> Modulo -> It gives the remainder.

9. alert -> This creates a pop-up and shows in the browser.
10 prompt -> This is used to take the input from the user.]
-> In prompt we can give hint text.

11. Rules for a variable name
-> Start a variable name with a alphabet or underscore

12. JS is a case sensitive scripting language -> If we created a variable with name ABCD (All caps), then in order to use it we nned to use ABCD (All caps) only.

13. Semantics -> For readability. Give meaningful variable names.

/* ANY FOOL CAN WRITE A CODE THAT COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND BUT A GOOD PROGRAMMER WILL WRITE A CODE THAT HUMAN's CAN UNDERSTAND
-Martin Fowler*/

14. JS is an interpreted language means it is executed line by line
if my script were to crash at any line than any code written after that line will not be executed

15. Number + Number -> Mathematical addition
Number + string -> String concatenation (Combining)
